                                    and sell
                                    crypto on its platform.
                                    After rolling out the ability to buy and sell crypto on its platform in October
                                    2020,
                                    PayPal is finally allowing users the ability to natively transfer, send and receive

                                    assets between PayPal and other wallets and exchanges. <br> <br> As of Tuesday, the feature
                                    is available to select U.S. users, with the feature expanding to all eligible U.S.

                                    In addition, customers who transfer their crypto onto PayPal can spend it via

                                    Users would simply need to log in to their accounts and enter the crypto section of
                                    the application to start transferring coins. Users are generally required to
                                    complete a
                                    one-time ID verification before the procedure. <span id="dots1">....</span>

                                <img class="icon" src="c_news3.png" alt="">

                                <p class="text">2022 has been a rough and tough year for investors, traders,
                                    cryptocurrency
                                    businesses, and miners in general. The prolonged bear market, exacerbated by a
                                    series of catastrophic events, posed a threat to miners.
                                    Miners were dealing with a variety of issues, including defaulted loans, quarterly
                                    losses, and soaring bitcoin hashrates that reached all-time highs. All these factors
                                    were affecting the profitability of the miners and were causing sell pressure.
                                    <br> <br> The situation was aggravated when cryptocurrency prices, including Bitcoin’s,
                                    plummeted. Bitcoin, which was hovering around $48,000 last year, hit a low of
                                    $15,590 by the end of 2022. According to the data collected from The Block, bitcoin
                                    miners’ revenue hit $9.55 billion in 2022.
                                    Bitcoin miners’ revenue dropped in 2022 <span id="dots4">...</span><span id="more4">
                                        Bitcoin, which is trading at $16,721 at press time, has been on a downward
                                        spiral
                                        alongside other cryptocurrencies. <br> <br> The falling cryptocurrency prices had a major
                                        effect on the income and profits of miners. Even though the $9.55 billion in
                                        revenue
                                        in 2022 seems like a large number, it is comparatively lower than that of 2021.
                                        Over the course of 2021, bitcoin miners made more than $15 billion in revenue,
                                        according to the data from the block. This was actually considered to be a 206%
                                        year-over-year increase.</span></p>

                                <img class="icon" src="d_news5.png" alt="">

                                <p class="text">Avraham Eisenberg, the crypto investor whose <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/22/mango-exploiter-gets-liquidated-after-roiling-aave-using-20m-of-borrowed-curve-tokens/" class="green">“highly profitable trading strategy"</a> 
                                    strategy” drained DeFi trading platform Mango Markets of crypto worth $110 million,
                                    was arrested Monday in Puerto Rico, court documents said.
                                    The self-described game theorist admitted his role in draining Mango Markets’
                                    treasury shortly after the incident in mid-October, and may now be the first U.S.
                                    resident to face charges for his role in manipulating a decentralized-finance
                                    trading platform.
                                    <br> <br> Eisenberg faces charges of commodities fraud and commodities manipulation, according
                                    to a filing unsealed Tuesday. The charges could see punishments ranging from fines
                                    to prison time.
                                    A deposition signed by FBI Special Agent Brandon Racz alleges Eisenberg “willfully
                                    and knowingly” manipulated the sale of a commodity – namely futures contracts on
                                    Mango Markets.
                                    “Eisenberg engaged in a scheme involving the intentional and artificial manipulation
                                    of the price of perpetual futures contracts on a cryptocurrency exchange called
                                    Mango Markets, and other manipulative and deceptive devices and contrivances.”

                                    Eisenberg was arrested Monday night in Puerto Rico, according to a second filing
                                    signed by Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Burnett. <span id="dots5">...</span>
                                    <span id="more5">
                                    <br> <br> According to the unsealed complaint, Eisenberg manipulated the price of perpetuals
                                    contracts (a type of futures contract popular in crypto markets) for Mango Markets’
                                    native token MNGO. He sold massive amounts of MNGO perpetuals contracts to himself,
                                    thus pumping the price of those contracts 1,300% in less than an hour.
                                    Up big time, Eisenberg then borrowed against the value of his position and “withdrew
                                    essentially all of the cryptocurrency deposits on the Mango Markets platform.” He
                                    made $110 million, according to the complaint.
                                    The platform became “insolvent” as a result, the deposition said, quoting
                                    <a href="https://twitter.com/avi_eisen/status/1581326202731913216" class="green"></a> Eisenberg’s own Twitter account.
                                    <br> <br> In the wake of the trade, Eisenberg <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/12/mango-markets-hacker-provides-ultimatum-repay-bad-debt/" class="green"> negotiated</a> with Mango Markets and agreed to
                                    return $67 million to the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governing it.
                                    Mango DAO planned to return those funds to users who were affected by Eisenberg’s
                                    attack.
